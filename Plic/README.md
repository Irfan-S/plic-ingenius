# Plic
Companion tool for Posturect on Laptops

Two versions:
- Using NewPing, code has been tested, and is ready for further prototyping and development.
- Using default Arduino library, code does work, but is error prone.

# How to run:
- If using NewPing, and using a piezo speaker, install the library, navigate to NewPing.h and change the `TIMER_ENABLED` flag to false. This allows you to use the buzzer to notify for alerts.
