## PlicCompanion Application for Desktops
This is the PlicCompanion application for desktop to be used in conjunction with the PlicInc device. <br>
### Important
There are three dummy buttons in the top right corner to simulate input from arduino. These buttons will not be present in the final build once the hardware prototyping is complete:
* F0:
     * Three states: Normal, slightly bad posture, very bad posture
* F1:
     * Used to simulate user being absent from workspace
* Connect/Disconnect:
     * Used to simulate a disconnection of the PlicInc device
